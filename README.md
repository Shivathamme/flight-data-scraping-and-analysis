# Flight Data Scraping and Analysis ✈️

## Project Overview
This project scrapes flight data from an online travel website using Selenium, transforms the extracted information into a structured dataset, and performs exploratory data analysis to identify pricing patterns, airline-wise comparisons, and route-based insights using Python.

---

## Route Scope
This analysis focuses on a single flight route: **Hyderabad → Delhi**.  
By limiting the dataset to one route, the project enables fair and consistent comparison of airfare pricing, airline strategies, fare types, and service offerings without variations caused by route distance differences.

---

## Dataset Description
The dataset is created by scraping live flight listings and includes the following columns:

- Airline  
- Flight Number  
- Departure City  
- Departure Time  
- Arrival City  
- Arrival Time  
- Duration  
- Stops  
- Fare Type  
- Fare Price  
- Cancellation Policy  
- Date Change Policy  
- Seat Selection  
- Checked Baggage  
- Hand Baggage  
- Meal

## Project Objectives
- Scrape real-world flight data using Selenium  
- Convert scraped data into a structured Pandas DataFrame  
- Clean and preprocess the dataset  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Visualize pricing and airline-wise trends  

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Selenium  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## Project Workflow
1. Data scraping using Selenium WebDriver  
2. Saving scraped data into CSV format  
3. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization

## Key Insights
- Flight fares vary across airlines and fare types.
- Airline-wise average fare comparison highlights pricing differences.
- Flights with longer duration or additional services generally have higher fares.
- Number of stops and departure time influence airfare pricing.
